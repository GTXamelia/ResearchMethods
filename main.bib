    Abstract =      {Providing fundamental knowledge necessary to understand graphene's atomic structure, band-structure, unique properties and an overview of groundbreaking current and emergent applications, this new handbook is essential reading for materials scientists, chemists and physicists. Since the 2010 physics Nobel Prize awarded to Geim and Novosolev for their groundbreaking work isolating graphene from bulk graphite, there has been a huge surge in interest in the area. This has led to a large number of news books on graphene. However, for such a vast inflow of new entrants, the current literature is surprisingly slight, focusing exclusively on current research or books on previous'hot topic'allotropes of carbon. This book covers fundamental groundwork of the structure, property, characterization methods and applications of graphene, along with providing the necessary knowledge of graphene's atomic structure, how it relates to its band-structure and how this in turn leads to the amazing propert},

Especially, the rapid     development of nanotechnology in recent years promises a lot of applications in condensed matter physics, surface science and nanodevices, which are growing interests in fundamental issues, computational techniques and potential applications of quantum tunneling.The book involves two relevant topics. One is quantum tunneling theory in condensed matter physics, including the basic concepts and methods, especially for recent developments in mesoscopic physics and computational formulation. The second part is the field electron emission theory, which covers the basic field emission concepts, the Fowler-Nordheim theory, and recent developments of the field emission theory especially in some fundamental concepts and computational formulation, such as quantum confinement effects, Dirac fermion, Luttinger liquid, carbon nanotubes, coherent emission current, quantum tunneling time problem, spin polarized field e},
